##### 

##### Difficulties encountered 

```
1. v-for refs
refs is not reactive, and v-for is in-patch insert
2. webpack.dev.config
webpack uses express as default
insert app.use in before
3. audio play error
should handle Promise
4. Constructor
base components only handle basic things
like new a class or emit an event
5. Vuex mutate state
array should use slice() to make a copy
6. Make proper data structure
maintain the playlist and sequencelist
handle edge cases always
set flag and watch proper data
7. scroll
should recalculate the clientHeight after dom change, or use the this.$nextTick
```
